What is taskManager
###################

taskManager is a small app on which you can save, edit, delete your tasks.


###################
How It Works
###################


In the application, first we have to login using the credentials.
After successful login, it will show you all of your tasks (if there is any).
Then on the right side there is a button named Create Task. By clicking on it we can add a task.
To add a task we have to provide the name and task description. After  clicking save button, task will be saved and will be showed on the dashboard.

From the dashboard we can also edit the task or delete the task.

If we click EDIT button, it will take us to a different page where we can edit the task and save it again.
And if we DELETE Button, it will delete the task and also show a confirmation message.







*******************
Release Information
*******************

This repo contains in-development code for future releases.

*******************
Server Requirements
*******************

PHP version 5.4 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.2.4 as well, but we strongly advise you NOT to run
such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance
issues, as well as missing features.
